##Running the Script
1. Download the [rgbif](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgbif/rgbif.pdf) package manually in R, within Hoffman2. <br>
In the command line, type the following:

$module load R <br>
$R <br>
  >install.packages("rgbif")<br>
  
After the package has installed, return to Hoffman2. <br>
  >quit() <br>
  
2. In order to run the bash script, the bash script and R scripts must be in the same directory as the eDNA data set.<br>
  To run the bash script, do the following.<br>
  $sh bashscript.sh datasetfile.txt <br>
  
  **This Vignette directory contains a file called vignette.txt with detailed step-by-step instructions on how to use the scripts and what the outputs should look like**
