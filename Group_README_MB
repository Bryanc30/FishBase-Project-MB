# Suggestions for a good README
# Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to your
# project. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source
# projects Readme files typically tell potential users:

# The name of the program
# Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

	# Name: To be determined.

# The authors of the programs
# Name of students in your group

	# Authors: Bryan, Maria 

# The purpose for writing the program 
# Let people know what your program can do specifically. Provide context and add
# a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features 
# or a Background subsection can also be added here. Also, depending on what you 
# are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or images. Remember 
# your favorite animal repository!!

	# Purpose: The main purpose of the program will be to take data from
	# the fishbase site and format it in such a way that makes it easier
	# for someone to look for a specific component. This might be automatically
	# creating histograms of certain traits among certain sets of fish, for example.

# What they need to have installed to run the program
# However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a 
# novice and would like more guidance. Do they need R packages? Python Libraries?

	# To be determined.

# How to actually use the program 
# The commands to run, how to access the help menu, etc. Show the expected output 
# if you can. Itâ€™s helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you 
# can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they 
# are too long to reasonably include in the README.

	# To be determined.

# In summary, you want your Readme to attract potential users, then convince them 
# that you program is awesome, and show them how to use it.
